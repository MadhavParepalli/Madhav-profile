        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I’m Madhav Parepalli, a web developer who loves building websites that look good and work smoothly. My
            journey started with a curiosity about how websites work, and now I get to create them! I enjoy working with
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to bring ideas to life online.

            My goal is to make websites that are easy to use and accessible to everyone. I’m always looking for ways to
            make things better and find solutions to challenges along the way.

            When I’m not coding, you can find me listening to music, playing new songs, or hitting the badminton court.
            These hobbies help me stay energized and inspired for my work.

            <h3>Smart Voting Through Facial Recognition</h3>
            <p> smart voting with facial recognition is a system that verifies a voter’s identity through facial scans, 
                I aim to reduce fraud and streamline the voting experience. This approach not only speeds up the process 
                by eliminating the need for physical IDs but also enhances trust in the system. My goal is to create a secure, 
                user-friendly voting experience while carefully handling privacy and ethical
                considerations to protect voter data.</p>

            <h3>Fake News Detection</h3>
            <p>Developed a machine learning model to detect and classify fake news. The model utilized a combination of 
                techniques, including text preprocessing, feature extraction,and machine learning algorithms. The model 
                achieved an accuracy of 90% on a test dataset. </p>
